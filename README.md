FinCatcher - Financial Tracking APP

"FinCatcher" encapsulates the idea of actively gathering and managing financial elements,
ensuring nothing slips through unnoticed. Much like a dream catcher filters out unwanted dreams
while allowing good ones to pass, a FinCatcher can symbolize discerning financial decisions—capturing
beneficial financial actions and organizing them in a harmonious way.
It suggests vigilance and intentionality in financial management.
